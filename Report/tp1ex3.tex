\subsubsection{Schedulability}

To study the schedulability of a task set, the processor load is used in order to determine with which algorithm it is possible the task set is schedulable. \\

For the first task set, the processor load is the following : \\

$U_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{C_i}{T_i} = 0.958$ \\

The value of $U_1$ is greater than $n(2^{\frac{1}{n}}-1)$ (with $n$ the number of tasks) which is equal to 0.779. It is then not schedulable with RM, but $U_1$ is still lesser than 1, making the task set schedulable with EDF. \\

When it comes to the seconde task set, the processor load's value is $U_2 = 0.852$. Like the first task set, it is schedulable with EDF, but not with RM. \\
