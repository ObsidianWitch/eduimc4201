\subsection{Ex2 - Watchdog}

The aim of this exercise is to implement a watchdog task which will check if a counter task respects time constraints. The two following constraints must be respected :
\begin{itemize}
    \item The counter must be incremented within 150 ms of its release.
    \item The watchdog inspection must last less than 100 ms.
\end{itemize}
If one of those constraints is not respected, an error message is printed.\\

In order to see these errors, the counter task's period starts at 50 ms and is increased at each iteration by 10 ms until it reaches 200 ms. This is done with the \textbf{rt\_task\_set\_resume\_end\_times()} function which can set the relative resume and termination times of a task.\\

While the counter task is a periodic task, the watchdog task is not and possesses a higher priority. The watchdog waits for a resource to be available trough a semaphore with the \textbf{rt\_sem\_wait\_timed()} function which timeouts when the \emph{delay} given in parameter is reached. Each time the counter is incremented, a resource is made available (\textbf{rt\_sem\_signal()}).
